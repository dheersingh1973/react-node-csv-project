# React Node CSV Project

This is a full-stack application that demonstrates a React frontend interacting with a Node.js backend to handle CSV data. 

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React application. See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for more details.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js Express server. See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for more details.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd react-node-csv-project
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    Navigate to the `backend` directory and follow its setup instructions.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and follow its setup instructions.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

After both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port the frontend is configured to use).
